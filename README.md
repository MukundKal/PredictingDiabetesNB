# Predicting Diabetes

Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, build a gaussian naive bayes supervised machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

Original data file is _pima-data.csv_ or can be downloaded at [Pima Indians Diabetes Database.](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/downloads/pima-indians-diabetes-database.zip/1)

After preprocessing using the **data-preprocessing.py** and **plot-correlation.py** programs, the cleaned data has been
exported to _precessed-pima.csv_.

The training and evaluation on the model is implemented in **pima-prediction.py** 
Achieved Accuracy of _75%_ approximately on test-spilt. 


Still working on to improve accuracy!
